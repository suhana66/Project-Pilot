title: Learn Object-Oriented Programming with a Space Invaders Game
category: Project Guidelines
level: 1
---

## Overview
In this project, you will create a 2D Space Invaders game from scratch. Space Invaders is a classic arcade game where players control a spaceship and defend the Earth from incoming waves of alien invaders. You will build build a complete game with player movement, shooting mechanics, enemy behavior, scoring system, and user interface. After development, you will convert the application to a standalone executable, making it easier to distribute.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to help you learn game development concepts such as game loop, collision detection, sprite handling, and movement mechanics. You will also experiment with object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction during this project.

## Deliverables
At the end of this project, you will have:

1. Source code of the game, which may be spread among multiple files.
2. A README file with instructions on installation, game controls and credits.
3. An executable file that allows the game to be played on a local machine.

## Covered Concepts
- Components of Game Development
- Game Mechanics Implementation
- Sprite Handling and Positioning
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- User Interface (UI) Design
- Executable Creation

## Requirements

### Game Mechanics
- Implement a player-controlled spaceship that can move horizontally and fire missiles at enemy ships.
- Implement enemy ships that move horizontally and vertically and fire missiles at the player.
- Implement a score system that tracks the player's points as they destroy enemy ships.
- Implement a game over screen that displays the final score and allows the player to restart the game.
- Implement a game start screen that is displayed when the player runs the program.

### Implementation
- Implement the game using object-oriented programming concepts.
- Use classes to define the game objects (player, enemy, missiles, etc.) and their behavior.
- Use inheritance and polymorphism to minimize code duplication and simplify maintenance.
- Use encapsulation to ensure that each game object is responsible for its own behavior and state.
- All your code should be well-documented, including comments where necessary.

### Visuals
- Create or import game graphics for the different sprites in the game.
- Display the score of the player throughout game play.
- Create a tutorial that teaches the player how to play the game.
- Provide clear instructions on how to navigate the game's controls and mechanics.
- Add a background to create a visually appealing environment.

## Optional Enhancements
- Create multiple levels with increasing difficulty. Each level can have different types of enemies and obstacles.
- Implement a system to keep track of high scores and display them on a leaderboard.
- Create a mode where two players can play against each other on the same computer, either cooperatively or competitively.
- Create different types of enemies with unique behaviors and attacks, such as enemies that move faster or shoot more frequently.
- Implement sound effects for the player, enemy ships, missiles, and game events.
- Allow players to choose different skins for the game to customize their gameplay experience.
