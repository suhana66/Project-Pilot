title: Learn Programming Fundamentals with a Terminal-based Calculator
category: Project Guidelines
level: 2
---

## Overview
In this project, you will create a terminal-based calculator that performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division from scratch. The calculator will accept input from the user, perform the specified operation, and display the result.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to help you learn and practice programming fundamentals such as input/output, data types and structures, functions, and control flow.


## Deliverables
At the end of this project, you will have:

1. A script (or scripts) that implements a terminal-based calculator.
2. A README file with instructions on how to use the calculator and explanations of the code.

## Covered Concepts
- Programming Fundamentals
- Input/output handling
- Exception handling
- Data manipulation and data types
- Regular expressions
- Code organization and documentation

## Requirements

### Basic Calculator Functions
- The calculator should be able to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on two numbers.
- The calculator should handle invalid input from the user and display appropriate error messages.
- The calculator should have a "quit" or "exit" command that allows the user to exit the program.

### Additional Calculator Functions
- Add the ability to perform exponentiation and logarithmic operations.
- Add the ability to perform least common multiple and greatest common devisor operations.
- Add the ability to round up or round down the displayed result.
- Add the ability to obtain the absolute value of the displayed.

### Code Structure
- Organize your code into functions that perform specific tasks.
- Use comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each function.
- Use clear and descriptive variable names.
- Provide clear instructions and prompts for user input.

### Implementation
- Use an imported module (either a built-in or custom module) to implement the calculator operations.
- Use exception handling to handle invalid input from the user.
- Use a loop to allow the user to perform calculations continuously until the user quits the program.
- Use regular expressions to analyze user input.

## Optional Enhancements
- Add more advanced functions such as trigonometric functions and complex numbers.
- Add support for scientific notation and floating-point arithmetic.
- Create a GUI version of the calculator using a GUI library.
- Add the ability to store and recall previous calculations.
