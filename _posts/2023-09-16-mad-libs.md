## Introduction to Mad Libs

Mad Libs is a fun word game that involves filling in the blanks in a provided story with different types of words (such as nouns, adjectives, names, numbers, etc.).

**Take this story, for example.**
```
Pizza was invented by a creative Italian chef named Luigi. To make a pizza, you need to take a lump of dough, and make a thin, round crust. Then you cover it with savory sauce, melted cheese, and fresh chopped vegetables. Next, you have to bake it in a very hot oven. When it is done, cut it into eight slices. Some people like pepperoni pizza the best, but my favorite is the margherita pizza. If I could, I would eat pizza 3 times a day!
```

**This template can be created from this story.**
```
Pizza was invented by a {adjective} {nationality} chef named {name}. To make a pizza, you need to take a lump of {noun}, and make a thin, round {adjective} {noun}. Then you cover it with {adjective} sauce, {adjective} cheese, and fresh chopped {plural noun}. Next you have to bake it in a very hot {noun}. When it is done, cut it into {number} {shapes}. Some people like {food} pizza the best, but my favorite is the {food} pizza. If I could, I would eat pizza {number} times a day!
```

**Replacing the empty spaces with random words can create a fun version of the original story.**
```
Pizza was invented by a mischievous Martian chef named Zog. To make a pizza, you need to take a lump of moon rock, and make a thin, round radioactive pizza. Then you cover it with slimy sauce, gooey cheese, and fresh chopped tentacles. Next, you have to bake it in a very hot volcano. When it is done, cut it into 12 trapezoids. Some people like asteroid pizza the best, but my favorite is the wormhole pizza. If I could, I would eat pizza 42 times a day!
```

## Building a Mad Libs Generator in Python

### Step 1: Define the Mad Lib Template
We define the template in a **variable** called `template` that contains a **string** with placeholders. Curly braces `{}` are used as placeholders in a Python string to dynamically insert values into the string using the `format()` method. Any text between the curly braces are the names of the placeholders and follow the same rules as variable names.

{% include external_link.html topic="strings in Python" link="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp" %}

```{{ page.language }}
template = "Pizza was invented by a {adjective} {nationality} chef named {name}. To make a pizza, you need to take a lump of {noun}, and make a thin, round {adjective} {noun}. Then you cover it with {adjective} sauce, {adjective} cheese, and fresh chopped {plural noun}. Next you have to bake it in a very hot {noun}. When it is done, cut it into {number} {shapes}. Some people like {food} pizza the best, but my favorite is the {food} pizza. If I could, I would eat pizza {number} times a day!"
```

We use empty curly braces to define where to insert values in the string `template`. We defined a **list** of strings called `words` containing descriptors for each placeholder in the template string.

{% include external_link.html topic="lists in Python" link="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp" %}

```{{ page.language }}
template = "Pizza was invented by a {} {} chef named {}. To make a pizza, you need to take a lump of {}, and make a thin, round {} {}. Then you cover it with {} sauce, {} cheese, and fresh chopped {}. Next you have to bake it in a very hot {}. When it is done, cut it into {} {}. Some people like {} pizza the best, but my favorite is the {} pizza. If I could, I would eat pizza {} times a day!"

words = [
    "adjective", "nationality", "name", "noun", "adjective", "noun", "adjective",
    "adjective", "plural noun", "noun", "number", "shapes", "food", "food", "number"
]
```

### Step 2: Input Words from the User
In the code below, we utilize a concept in computer science called **iteration**. In iteration, we repeat steps or instructions, over and over again. This is often called a **loop**. There are different types of loops in Python. In this case, a `for loop` is used. Here, `i` is a counter that iterates through the `range` function of elements. The `len` function returns the length of a given list. The first element of the list will be `words[0]`, the second element of the list will be `words[1]`, and so on. This is called **indexing**. Each word type given in the list is replaced with a candidate word using the `input` function. We use the `input` function to take text input from the user.

{% include external_link.html topic="for loops in Python" link="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp" %}

{% include external_link.html topic="indexing in Python" link="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/slicing-and-indexing-in-python/#:~:text=Indexing%20is%20the%20process%20of,position%201%2C%20and%20so%20on." %}

{% include external_link.html topic="the input function in Python" link="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_input.asp" %}

{% include external_link.html topic="the range function in Python" link="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_range.asp" %}

{% include external_link.html topic="the len function in Python" link="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_len.asp" %}

```{{ page.language }}
for i in range(len(words)):
    words[i] = input(f"Enter a/an {words[i]}: ")
```

In order to determine the article to be used for the inputted word, we use a **conditional**, commonly referred to as an `if-else block`. `words[i][0]` signifies the first character in the string `words[i]`. In this particular case, the `in` keyword is used to check if a value is present in the list i.e. if the first character in `words[i]` is in the list of vowels. In this instance, we can shorten the `if-else block` using **ternary operators**. They follow the syntax `(value on true) if (condition) else (value on false)` and cannot be applied in every case.

{% include external_link.html topic="conditionals in Python" link="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp" %}

{% include external_link.html topic="ternary operators in Python" link="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-tenary-operator/" %}

{% include external_link.html topic="the in keyword in Python" link="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_in.asp" %}

```{{ page.language }}
for i in range(len(words)):
    article = "an" if words[i][0] in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"] else "a"
    words[i] = input(f"Enter {article} {words[i]}: ")
```

### Step 3: Fill in the Template

We are going to use the `format()` function in Python to fill our Mad Libs template with the words in the `words` list. The `format()` function inserts the specified value(s) within the curly braces in the string.

{% include external_link.html topic="string formatting in Python" link="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_format.asp" %}

```{{ page.language }}
mad_lib = template.format(*words)
```

The `format()` function takes a comma separated sequence of values, a list would cause an error. Therefore, we need to use a **destructuring operator** to pass a comma separated sequence formed from the elements in the `words` list to the `format()` function. Destructuring operators in Python are illustrated in the code block below.

{% include external_link.html topic="destructuring operators in Python" link="https://bas.codes/posts/python-asterisks" %}

```{{ page.language }}
>>> test = ["element1", "element2", "element3"]
>>> print(test)                                 # print(["element1", "element2", "element3"])
['element1', 'element2', 'element3']
>>> print(test)                                 # print("element1", "element2", "element3")
element1 element2 element3
```

### Step 4: Display the Generated Mad Lib

The `print()` function in Python is used to display text on the screen. All print statements end with a newline character (`\n`) by default. Adding newline characters to the string being printed and empty `print()` functions (that creates a newline) are some techniques we can employ to improve the readability of the outputted text.

{% include external_link.html topic="outputting text to the screen in Python" link="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_print.asp" %}

```{{ page.language }}
print("\nYour Mad Lib Story:\n")
print(mad_lib)
print()
```

### Putting It All Together

Lines beginning with a `#` character in Python are referred to as **comments**. When used properly, comments enhance code readability and offer explanations for human developers. Comments are never executed by the computer; they solely serve as documentation for the code.

{% include external_link.html topic="comments in Python" link="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_comments.asp" %}

```{{ page.language }}
# Define the template
template = "Pizza was invented by a {} {} chef named {}. To make a pizza, you need to take a lump of {}, and make a thin, round {} {}. Then you cover it with {} sauce, {} cheese, and fresh chopped {}. Next you have to bake it in a very hot {}. When it is done, cut it into {} {}. Some people like {} pizza the best, but my favorite is the {} pizza. If I could, I would eat pizza {} times a day!"

# Input words from the user
words = [
    "adjective", "nationality", "name", "noun", "adjective", "noun", "adjective",
    "adjective", "plural noun", "noun", "number", "shapes", "food", "food", "number"
]

for i in range(len(words)):
    article = "an" if words[i][0] in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"] else "a"
    words[i] = input(f"Enter {article} {words[i]}: ")

# Fill in the template
mad_lib = template.format(*words)

# Print the generated Mad Lib
print("\nYour Mad Lib Story:\n")
print(mad_lib)
print()
```
